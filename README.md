# responsiveapp

In this assignment:

1. I utilized Bootstrap stylings to create three responsive webpages. One is the homepage, providing a brief bio about myself.  The second page serves as a placeholder for future projects that will be added to my portfolio.  The third page serves as a contact me page for when the page is ultimately completed.  I installed the Bootstrap styling link into the head section of the webpages to access the various stylings and components provided by Bootstrap, including the navigation bar, the grid system, background coloring and text coloring.
2. I utilized Google Fonts to update the fonts used within my paragraph and navigation tags.  
3. I also created a CSS styling page to create a custom bankground image for the website
4. Finally, I utilized Font Awesome to include clickable LinkedIn and GitHub icons.
